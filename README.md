The period positive game for all. Play by dragging the planets away from one another to avoid collision!

Please note this game is a WIP, the artwork and functionality is not finished yet.

I was able to continuously test this mobile game using the Unity Remote 5 application and plugging into a computer. Whilst on the application on your phone, click Play in the Unity engine, and the game should run on your mobile.

There are two scenes, MainMenu and Game, but unfortunately the button linking the two does not work yet. Please navigate across MainMenu to Game in Assets/Scenes in order to see both.
